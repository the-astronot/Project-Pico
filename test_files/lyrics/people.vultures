People-vultures
God approaches
Final hearing
What else have I got left to spew down?

People-vultures waiting to begin
Deadly ulcers feeding on my skin

People-vultures waiting by my stage
Wild dogs escaping from their cage

People-vultures
God approaches
Final hearing
What else have I got left to spew down?

People-vultures
God approaches
Final hearing
Disappearing
Tainted voodoo
Headless guru
Final head-spin
What else have I got left to spew down?

What else have I got left to spew down?
What else have I got left to spew down?
What else have I got left to spew down?
What else have I got left to spew down?

People-vultures crowding at my door
Parasites are eating more and more
